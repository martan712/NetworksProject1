"""This exposes a constant bytes object called TEST_BYTES_128MIB which, as the
name suggests, is 128 MiB in size. You can send it, receive it, and check it
for equality on the receiving end.

Pycharm may complain about an unresolved reference. This is a lie. It simply
cannot deal with a python source file this large so it cannot resolve the
reference. Python itself will run it fine, though.

You can also use the file large_input.py as-is for file transfer.
